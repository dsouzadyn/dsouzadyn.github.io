## Straight forward solution

Using the hint provided in the README, extracting the flag is pretty straight forward.
```
$ strings main32 or main64
A4khf
<flag_here>
It's easy just look harder :)
main.asm
__bss_start
_edata
_end
.symtab
.strtab
.shstrtab
.note.gnu.build-id
.text
.data
```

## Not so striaght forward but cool way

In this method we'll make use of an awesome tool called radare2 which you can grab from [here](https://github.com/radare/radare2).

1. First open the binary in radare2
```
$ r2 main32 or main64
```

2. Then analyze the binary
```
[...]> aaa
```

3. Disassemble the main function just to check what's going on.
```
[...]> pdf
```
Nothing interesting over here.

4. Now print the strings
```
[...]> iz
```
And there you have it.
